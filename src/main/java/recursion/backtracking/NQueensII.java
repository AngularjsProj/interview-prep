The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
*
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(N!), where N is the number of queens (which is the same as the width and height of the board).

Unlike the brute force approach, we place a queen only on squares that aren't attacked. For the first queen, we have N
* options. For the next queen, we won't attempt to place it in the same column as the first queen, and there must be at
* least one square attacked diagonally by the first queen as well. Thus, the maximum number of squares we can consider
* for the second queen is Nâˆ’2. For the third queen, we won't attempt to place it in 2 columns already occupied by
* the first 2 queens, and there must be at least two squares attacked diagonally from the first 2 queens. Thus, the
* maximum number of squares we can consider for the third queen is N - 4. This pattern continues, giving an approximate
* time complexity of N! at the end.

Space complexity: O(N), where NN is the number of queens (which is the same as the width and height of the board).

Extra memory used includes the 3 sets used to store board state, as well as the recursion call stack. All of this scales
* linearly with the number of queens.
