#_System Requirements_
- We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing our Bike Rental System:

  - The system will support the renting of different bicycles like Mountain, Road, Hybrid, Electric, and Premium.

  - Each Bike should be added with a unique barcode and other details, including a parking stall number which helps to 
    locate the Bike.

  - The system should be able to retrieve information like which member took a particular Bike or what Bikes have been 
    rented out by a specific member.

  - The system should collect a late-fee for bikes returned after the due date.

  - Members should be able to search the bikes inventory and reserve any available bike.

  - The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation is approaching the pick-up date, as well as 
    when the bike is nearing the due date or has not been returned within the due date.

  - The system will be able to read barcodes from bikes.

  - Members should be able to cancel their reservations.

  - The system should maintain a bike log to track all events related to the bikes.

  - Members can add rental insurance to their reservation.

  - Members can rent additional equipment, like lock, child carrier, helmet, night lights and pedals etc.

  - Members can add additional services to their reservation, such as roadside assistance, additional rider, etc.
