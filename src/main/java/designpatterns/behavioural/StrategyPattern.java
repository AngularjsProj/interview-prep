Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithms for a specific task and the client decides the actual implementation be used at runtime.

A strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern. We define multiple algorithms and let client applications pass the
algorithm to be used as a parameter. One of the best examples of this pattern is the Collections.sort() method that takes
the Comparator parameter. Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting sorted in different ways.

Check out Strategy Pattern post for implementation details and example program.
