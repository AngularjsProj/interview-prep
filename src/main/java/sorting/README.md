**Sorting Algorithms:**

    TC -> O(N^2) && SC -> O(1)
    1. Selection Sort
    2. Bubble Sort
    3. Insertion Sort

    TC-> O(nlogn)
    1. Merge Sort
    2. Quick Sort

    Time Complexities of Sorting Algorithms (Overview)
    Here's a quick summary of the time complexity of sorting algorithms.
    Now that we’ve gone over how most famous and important sorting algorithms work, 
    here’s a quick table that you can refer to when you are solving coding problems!
                    Insertion	Selection	  Merge	      Quick	      Bubble
    Best case	    O(n)    	O(n^2)      O(nlog(n))	O(nlog(n))	  O(n)
    Average case	O(n^2)	    O(n^2)      O(nlog(n))	O(nlog(n))    O(n^2)
    Worst case	    O(n^2)      O(n^2)      O(nlog(n))	O(n^2)        O(n^2)
