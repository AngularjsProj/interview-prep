-  Power Rule
   - Please input 'Product Rule', 'Power Rule', 'Chain Rule', or 'Log Rule' ('Quit' to quit): Power Rule
   - Enter your function: (MULTIPLE TERMS AVAILABLE e.g. 'ax^b+cx^d+ex^f+...'):
   
-  Log Rule
   - Enter your function (form: a^x, MULTIPLE TERMS NOT AVAILABLE): 3^x
     Derivative: 3^xln(3)
     
- Product Rule
  - Enter your function (form: (ax^b+cx^d)*(ex^f+gx^h)): (3x^2+6x^4)*(3x^2+6x^4)
    Derivative: (3x^2+6x^4)*(6.0x^1.0+24.0x^3.0)+(3x^2+6x^4)*(6.0x^1.0+24.0x^3.0)
